1. Install the Minim library to allow the sound of birds to be loaded and played. (Sketch > Import Library... > Manage Libraries... > Install the Minim library)

2. Run the "group_5_assignment4.pde" file to begin the animation.

3. If desired, the arguments can be changed to affect the animation of the bird. In order of left to right, the arguments include floats for the x position, y position, bird speed, wing speed, x direction and y direction. Note that a positive x direction corresponds to moving to the right, negative x corresponds to the left, positive y direction corresponds to moving downwards, and negative y corresponds to moving upwards.
