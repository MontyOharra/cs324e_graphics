1. Open the "group_5_assignment6.pde" file and run it to begin the program.

2. To create fireworks, use the mouse and click anywhere in the window. Multiple fireworks can be made by clicking multiple times.

3. To change the color scheme of the fireworks, use the following keyboard inputs (Default setting is the first color scheme):

- Click "1" -> Blue squares, green stars
- Click "2" -> Red squares, orange stars
- Click "3" -> Yellow squares, pink stars

4. If desired, change the following global variables to affect the firework simulation: maxFireworks, gravity, springCoefficient, dampingCoefficient, debrisCount (The colorScheme variable is set to 0 to set the initial color scheme.) More in-depth information is specified in the project description regarding these global variables.

5. Click near the cloth object to create fireworks and ignite the cloth. The cloth will catch fire and begin to burn until it disappears. Note that fireworks cannot be made in the area that the cloth has fully burned.
