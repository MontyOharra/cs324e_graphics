I
am
rewriting
my
txt
files
in
this
txt
file
now.
Unfortunately,
during
testing,
my
text
file
got
deleted
by
processing
and
is
now
unrecoverable
somehow.

How
could
I
ever
recover
it?
Maybe
it
would
take
1,
or
2,
or
3
hours.
The
only
reason
for
those
last
two
sentences
is
to
include
different
characters
in
order
to
better
test
this
code.

Now
I
am
writing
a
third
paragraph,
because
although
the
hands
on
says
"paragraphs"
and
two
is
technically
plural,
I
feel
like
two
would
not
be
entirely
enough.
So,
therefore,
I
am
writing
this
third
paragraph
about
that,
because
I
can't
think
about
anything
else
to
write!
